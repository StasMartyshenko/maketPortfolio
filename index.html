                    <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary <br> time needed to understand your product vision.<br>
The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.<br> 
Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces <br> you need.</p>
